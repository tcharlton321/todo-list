# This is a todo list app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
and was created following a tutorial from [Nick Scialli](https://typeofnan.dev/your-first-react-typescript-project-todo-app/).\
Before the creation of this app I have never worked with JavaScript, and by extension TypeScript or ReactJS.

## Reason for this app

This app is purely for learning Typescript and React.\
This project originated from a frontend only Typescript/ReactJS tutorial linked above, with non-tutorial features added as an exercise.

## Planned features

~~Delete button: removes a Todo Item from the list~~\
~~Enter Key Submission: allows form submission on Enter~~\
Backend\
Database
